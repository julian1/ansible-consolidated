# Really not sure why we do not do all Nat at the router - instead of locally here.
# we just need to push the route - eg. 10.7.0.0/24 and then can run servers or whatever?
# doesn't mean that dns is local here
# router needs the route, and then locally.

# actually probably only need the router - with a 10.3.0.0/24  route to the laptop ... egress from laptop
# should be fine...
# will we don't have to change the gateway


## maybe change name vpc or virutal-cloud etc...

# services for container hosting, and management
# ethernet bridging, nat, dhcp, dns, iptables, centralized logging, local resolv.conf
